# CodeSnippets
Here are either small projects or ad-hoc undocumented projects I've been working on through 2019-2021. Note that many of these are outdated, poorly documented or both. Think of this space as my ADHD doom-drawer of code. 

Below short describtions of each snippet:

## ReviewScannarBazaarvoice
A simpel script to scrape reviews from BazaarVoice clients - which includes most retailers in EU and many Direct-To-Consumer webstores. 


## GetGoogleReviews
First working script for scraping reviews; I'm still researching inner workings of this API and its limits, full versions should appear mid 2023 on my github. 

## BerlinTwitterFollowersScrape
A simple example of Twitter scraiping with Python


## InstagramFollowerLocationCheck
One of my first larger Python projects that was done in a mini-hackathon. Sadly the urgent nature left the script extremely undocumented. 
Instagram has since changed a lot of its endpoints as well, so its significatly yet usable - but it offers a good insight into what goes into a data-scraping project from a highly complex and protected website.
