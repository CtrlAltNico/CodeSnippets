Here are either small projects or ad-hoc undocumented projects I've been working on through 2019-2021. Note that many of these are outdated, poorly documented or both. Think of this space as my ADHD doom-drawer of code.

## GetGoogleReviews
First working script for scraping reviews; I'm still researching inner workings of this API and its limits, full versions should appear mid 2023.

A simple example of Twitter scraiping with Python

One of my first larger Python projects that was done in a mini-hackathon. Sadly the urgent nature left the script extremely undocumented. 
Instagram has since changed a lot of its endpoints.
